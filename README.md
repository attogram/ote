[![Run Tests](https://github.com/attogram/ote/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/attogram/ote/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This is the development repository for the **Open Translation Engine (OTE) v2**, a collaborative translation dictionary manager. This project is currently a work-in-progress.

## OTE v2 Development

OTE v2 is being built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and is under active development. The goal is to create a modern, robust, and easy-to-use translation engine.

For a detailed, step-by-step guide on the MVP build process, please see [OTE2.md](OTE2.md).

    php artisan key:generate
    ```

### Testing

For information on how to run the test suite, please see the [Testing Documentation](tests/README.md).

### Deployment

This project is configured for automated deployment on [Render](https://render.com/). For detailed instructions on how to deploy your own instance, please see the [Render Deployment Guide](docs/RENDER.md).

## Development with GitHub Codespaces

This repository is configured to use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for a cloud-based development environment.

### Getting Started

1.  Click the "Code" button on the repository's main page.
2.  Select the "Codespaces" tab.
3.  Click "Create codespace on main".

GitHub will then create a new Codespace and set up the environment for you automatically. This includes:
- Building the Docker containers for the application, database, and Redis.
- Installing all Composer dependencies.
- Creating the `.env` file.
- Generating the application key.
- Running database migrations and seeding it with sample data.

### Usage

-   **Accessing the application:**
    Once the Codespace is ready, it will automatically forward the application's port (8000). To start the web server, run the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
    ```
    You can then access the application from the "Ports" tab in the VS Code editor or by clicking the notification that appears.

-   **Running Artisan commands:**
    You can run `artisan` commands directly in the VS Code terminal:
    ```bash
    php artisan route:list
    ```

-   **Running NPM commands:**
    You can also run `npm` commands in the terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

## Development Environment with Docker

This project includes a Docker-based development environment that allows you to run the application and its dependencies in isolated containers.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup

1.  **Build and start the containers:**

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up --build -d
    ```

    This command will build the Docker images and start the services in detached mode.

2.  **Install Composer dependencies:**

    Open a new terminal and run the following command to install the PHP dependencies using Composer.

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace composer install
    ```

3.  **Copy the environment file:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Generate the application key:**

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  **Seed the database (optional):**

    To populate the database with sample data, run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace php artisan db:seed
    ```

### Usage

-   **Accessing the application:**

    Once the containers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

-   **Running Artisan commands:**

    To run any `artisan` command, use `docker compose exec workspace php artisan <command>`. For example:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace php artisan route:list
    ```

-   **Running Composer commands:**

    To run any `composer` command, use `docker compose exec workspace composer <command>`. For example:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace composer update
    ```

-   **Running NPM commands:**

    To run any `npm` command, use `docker compose exec workspace npm <command>`. For example, to compile the frontend assets:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace npm install
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec workspace npm run dev
    ```

-   **Stopping the environment:**

    To stop the containers, run:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yml down
    ```
