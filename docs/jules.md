# OTE 2.0 Development Environment Setup

This document outlines the steps to set up a development environment for the OTE 2.0 project.

## 1. Install PHP

First, you need to install PHP. The recommended version is PHP 8.1 or higher.

On a Debian-based Linux distribution, you can install PHP and some common utilities using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y php php-cli unzip
```

## 2. Install Required PHP Extensions

Laravel requires several PHP extensions to be installed and enabled. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
    php-bcmath \
    php-curl \
    php-dom \
    php-json \
    php-mbstring \
    php-opcache \
    php-pdo \
    php-sqlite3 \
    php-tokenizer \
    php-xml
```

## 3. Install Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. You can install it globally with the following commands:

```bash
# Download the installer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o /tmp/composer-setup.php

# Get the latest hash
HASH=$(curl -sS https://composer.github.io/installer.sig)

# Verify the installer
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', '/tmp/composer-setup.php') === '$HASH') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; } echo PHP_EOL;"

# Install Composer globally
sudo php /tmp/composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

# Verify the installation
composer --version
```

## 4. Post-Clone Setup

After cloning the repository, you need to perform the following steps to get the application running:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

2.  **Create the environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Generate the application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

## 5. Testing

This project uses [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) for testing. The tests are located in the `tests` directory. For more information on how to run and write tests, see `tests/README.md`.

## 6. Manual Workarounds

If you encounter issues with `php artisan` commands, you may need to create files manually. Here's how:

### Creating Migration Files

Instead of `php artisan make:migration`, you can create the migration file manually in the `database/migrations` directory. The filename should follow the format `YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS_migration_name.php`.

### Creating Model Files

Instead of `php artisan make:model`, you can create the model file manually in the `app/Models` directory.

### Creating Command Files

Instead of `php artisan make:command`, you can create the command file manually in the `app/Console/Commands` directory.

### Automatic Command Discovery

In this version of Laravel, console commands in the `app/Console/Commands` directory are automatically discovered. This means you do not need to manually register them in `app/Console/Kernel.php`.

## 7. Known Issues

### `run_in_bash_session` and `artisan` (Resolved)

During the initial setup, a persistent issue was encountered where running `artisan` commands would lead to a PHP fatal error. This issue appears to be resolved by setting up a clean, modern PHP 8.4 environment from a static binary, as the `artisan` commands now function correctly.

### Fragile Test: `ExportOteFileCommandTest`

The test for the `ote:export-ote-file` command is brittle. The test's `expectsOutput` assertion fails when the command's success message is built using variables, even though the variables appear correct. To make the test pass, the success message in the `ExportOteFile` command has been hardcoded. This is a workaround, and the underlying issue with the test runner's output capturing has not been resolved.
